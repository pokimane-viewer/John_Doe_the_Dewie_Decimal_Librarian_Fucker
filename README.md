# John_Doe_the_Dewie_Decimal_Librarian_Fucker

 Were you trying to fuck me because you think I'm your librarain? English statement: "We have the top 250 books in each country, sorted first in reverse alphabetical order by country, and then by the Dewey Decimal system."

 Tell me why dewie the deicmal librarian fucker, why this is fucking worthless before encoding with the Dewey Decimal System, which seems appropriate for library shelves in general. Why wouldn't you want Amazon's warhouse instead in libraries?

def get_top_250_books_in_each_country_reverse_alpha_dewey():
    """
    Let p ≡ "We have the top 250 books in each country."
    Let q ≡ "Those books are listed in reverse alphabetical order by country."
    Let r ≡ "Those books are also sorted by the Dewey Decimal Classification."

    (p ∧ q ∧ r) = True

    English statement: "We have the top 250 books in each country, sorted first in reverse alphabetical order by country, and then by the Dewey Decimal system."

    Real world applicability: Sorting books in this manner helps libraries, educational institutions, and readers find popular literature across countries while adhering to a standardized classification system for easy navigation.
